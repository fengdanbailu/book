# Google Engineering Practices Documentation

Google has many generalized engineering practices that cover all languages and
all projects. These documents represent our collective experience of various best practices that we have developed over time. It is possible that open source projects or other organizations would benefit from this knowledge, so we work to make it available publicly when possible.

# 谷歌工程实践文档
谷歌有覆盖所有语言和项目的通用工程实践。这些文档表明了过去我们已经具备了大量最佳实践的合作经验。开源项目和其他组织会从这些文档中受益，所以我们的工作是尽可能地开源。

Currently this contains the following documents:

*   [Google's Code Review Guidelines](review/index.md), which are actually two separate sets of documents:
    *   [The Code Reviewer's Guide](review/reviewer/index.md)
    *   [The Change Author's Guide](review/developer/index.md)

当前主要包括以下文档：
* 谷歌审查代码，主要包括两部分：
	* 审查人手册
	* 开发者手册

## Terminology

There is some Google-internal terminology used in some of these documents, which we clarify here for external readers:

*   **CL**: Stands for "changelist," which means one self-contained change that has been submitted to version control or which is undergoing code review.
    Other organizations often call this a "change" or a "patch."
*   **LGTM**: Means "Looks Good to Me." It is what a code reviewer says when approving a CL.

## 术语解释
这些文档中有一些谷歌内部使用的术语，在这里做出说明：
* CL，全称changelist(变更清单)，意思是多次提交到一个版本，总的提交描述清单，方便审查代码。
*  LGTM，全称Looks Good to Me（看上去不错）. 意思是审查人通过了CL（变更清单）。
